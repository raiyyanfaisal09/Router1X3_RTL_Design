# Router1X3_RTL_Design
- A 1X3 Router (capable of routing the data packets to three different clients form a single source network) was designed, including a register module that can hold data packets momentarily, to pass onto three different FIFO memories along with a Finite State Machine and a Synchronizer that can manipulate the internal signals to carry out the necessary task in convenient manner.  - Most part of the project was simulated on Xilinx ISE and ISIM. Code Coverages were carried out on Questa Sim. Later Test Bench Verification was done by subjugating the RTL to the UVM based environment.
